The lack of reliable market price information significantly impacts farmers in Kenya, especially in rural areas with limited internet access. This project presents a USSD-based Crop Price Prediction System that provides farmers with real-time market prices and price predictions through basic mobile phones. The system combines machine learning algorithms for price prediction with USSD technology for accessibility, eliminating the need for smartphones or internet connectivity. 
Developed using PHP, MySQL, Python, and Africa's Talking API, the system demonstrated an 85% accuracy rate in price predictions and handles 950 concurrent users with response times averaging 2.3 seconds. Features include current price checking, predictions, price alerts, and SMS notifications. User acceptance testing with 100 farmers showed 90% satisfaction, proving the system's effectiveness in delivering complex data analytics through simple, accessible interfaces for informed agricultural decision-making.
